## Overview

In this project, I built an interactive rating component that allows a user to select a score from 1 to 5 and then submit it. After submission, they are redirected to a "Thank You" page where their selected rating is displayed.

### The challenge

1Ô∏è‚É£ Attaching event listeners to multiple buttons and getting their values:

- Solved by looping over ```querySelectorAll(".rating-btn button")``` and using ```index + 1``` as the score.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling shared JavaScript across multiple HTML files:

- Because both HTML files used the same ```index.js``` script, I had to ensure elements exist before attaching listeners to avoid null errors (e.g., checking if ```ratingBtns.length``` and ```submitBtn``` exist).

## My process

1Ô∏è‚É£ Design & structure:

Created two HTML pages:

Main rating page, with buttons for each score and a submit button.

Thank you page, to show the selected score.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Event handling:

Added event listeners to each rating button to capture which button was clicked.

Stored the selected score in a variable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data persistence & redirect:

Used localStorage to store the selected score temporarily.

On submit, redirected to the "Thank You" page using window.location.href.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Display selected score on new page:

- Retrieved the score from localStorage on the "Thank You" page.

- Rendered it inside a ``<p>`` element with class .rating-info.

- Removed the score from localStorage after use.

### Built with

- HTML: Page structure & semantic markup.

- CSS: Styling & responsive design (custom colors, hover states, layout).

- JavaScript: DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage for data sharing between pages.


### What I learned

- How to dynamically attach event listeners to multiple buttons and identify which was clicked.

- How to share data between different pages using localStorage.

- The importance of checking element existence when using the same JS file on multiple pages to prevent errors.

- How to handle redirects with ```window.location.href.```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```
